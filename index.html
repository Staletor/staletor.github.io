            <h2>Hi</h2>
            <p>
                Lately I've been inspired to lower my digital carbon footprint. So I decided to replace my fancy webpage containing large images and javascript files with a simple text-based webpage. My goal is to present myself as a designer without unnecessary impact on the planet. Hopefully I'm able to do so... 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: right;">...and yes, there's more.<br><strong>Just scroll down ↓</strong></p>

            <h2>Who am I</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Ståle Torger Stokke, and I'm a digital product designer from Norway. I have worked with digital products and services for over a decade. During my career I have been involved in start-ups and tech firms, but the last couple of years I have taken on the challenge to digitalize and create better public services. I work at <a href="https://aboveit.no/">Aboveit</a> as a Senior Consultant and Team Lead for a small group of designers.

            <h2>My passion</h2>
            <p>
                As a designer I’ve always been empathic towards the users, but I also love to discuss technology and business strategy. I believe a good designer must be able to create products that are desirable, feasible and viable without unnecessary impact on the planet. The later have recently become more important to me, trying to use digitalization to reduce environmental impact while still creating value and growth.

            <h3>Swing Catalyst</h3>
            <p class="no-margin">
                For four years I was involved in the development of a software used to analyze your golf swing. This was my first major role as a UX designer. Swing Catalyst is a complex analysis software combining video and sensor data. My contribution was to enable the user to utilize the data to improve their golf swing, and to create a more complete service including an app and online services.

            <p class="no-margin">
                This is a SCADA system for monitoring technical installation and energy consumption I worked with for two years. My role had two major functions being a UX designer for the continuous development of the system, while contributing to explore new business opportunities. During my time we expanded the service with the Check Point product, helping businesses to comply with food and health regulations.

            <h3>The Norwegian Tax Return</h3>
            <p>
                This project I’m really proud to have been part of, and definitely the largest UX challenge in my career so far. I spent three years as Design Lead, coordinating the user experience across several teams in this major and important governmental project. I can proudly say that we created a user friendly and fully accessible tax return for all citizens and businesses. With important outcome like increased happiness and understanding of the tax laws, improved quality in the data being reported and a decrease in the number of support cases.

            <h2>How did I do</h2>
            <p>
                As I said in the introduction my goal is to present myself as designer without unnecessary impact on the planet. My previous webpage produced <strong>1.51 grams of CO<sup>2</sup></strong> for every visit. I'm pleased to inform you that your visit to this page only produced <strong>0.01 grams of CO<sup>2</sup></strong>. And hopefully you still got an impression of me as a designer?
